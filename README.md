Advanced Predictive Modelling in Healthcare Data Analytics for Early Disease Detection and Proactive Medical Intervention
Overview
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a significant global health concern, and early detection plays a pivotal role in improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. In this project, we aim to develop a predictive model that assesses disease risk by integrating health metrics and lifestyle data. Our focus is on forecasting the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD).

Objectives
Early Detection: Enhance the ability to predict the risk of coronary artery disease using data-driven methodologies.
Model Development: Create a reliable prediction model by applying various data mining techniques.
Improving Patient Outcomes: Ultimately, contribute to improved patient outcomes through early intervention strategies.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:

id: Unique identifier
age: Age of the individual
sex: Gender of the individual
cp: Chest pain type
trestbps: Blood pressure during admission to the hospital
chol: Cholesterol level
fbs: Blood sugar level after an overnight fast (higher than 120 mg/dL)
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results
thalch: Maximum value of heart rate achieved
exang: Exercise-induced angina (pain in the heart due to exercise)
ca: Number of colored major vessels after fluoroscopy
thal: Thallium heart scan
num: Target variable indicating the presence of cardiovascular disease
Challenges Addressed
Missing Data: We handled missing data using mean/mode imputation.
Outliers: Addressed outliers affecting data quality.
Imbalance Check: Checked for imbalanced classes in the target variable.
Categorical Data Handling: Processed categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding.
Irrelevant Columns: Removed columns irrelevant to the predictive model.
Techniques Applied
Data Cleaning: Rigorous preprocessing, addressing missing values, outliers, and irrelevant data.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation of classification models.
This project showcases the application of various data mining techniques to build predictive models for early detection of cardiovascular diseases. The results indicate promising predictive capabilities, laying the groundwork for further refinement and application in real-world healthcare scenarios.
