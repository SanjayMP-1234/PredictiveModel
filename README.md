Predictive Modeling for Early Disease Detection
Description
This project focuses on developing predictive models for the early detection of diseases using machine learning techniques. By analyzing patient data, the models can identify patterns and risk factors that may indicate the onset of a disease, allowing for early intervention and improved patient outcomes.

Features
Early Detection: Uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of disease onset before symptoms appear.
Data-Driven: Analyzes patient data to identify risk factors.
Scalable: Can be adapted to different types of diseases and datasets.
Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-modeling-disease-detection.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd predictive-modeling-disease-detection
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
Usage
To train the models and make predictions:

Prepare your dataset and ensure it follows the required format.
Run the training script:
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py --dataset your_dataset.csv
Make predictions using the trained model:
bash
Copy code
python predict.py --model saved_model.pkl --data new_patient_data.csv
Dataset
The dataset used in this project should contain the following columns:

Patient ID
Features: (e.g., age, gender, medical history)
Target: Disease status (0 for healthy, 1 for disease)
The dataset is not included in this repository due to privacy concerns. You can use publicly available datasets or your own data.

Models
The project includes the following models:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Neural Networks
Each model can be trained and evaluated on the provided dataset. Model performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.

Results
The models achieved the following results on the test dataset:

Logistic Regression: Accuracy - 85%, AUC - 0.88
Random Forest: Accuracy - 90%, AUC - 0.92
SVM: Accuracy - 88%, AUC - 0.90
Neural Networks: Accuracy - 92%, AUC - 0.94
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of predictive modeling for early disease detection.
